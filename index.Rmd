## Are mass shootings getting worse in more recent years?
#### That's a great question to ask! So, we used the **mass shooting data** and plot the trend and the change of **numbers of victims** during the mass shootings from _1990 to 2017_.


```{r plot}
get_summary_plot()
```

From that, we can see the number of the victims are getting **higher** in the recent years comparing to 1990s. The number of fatalities during the mass shooting _reached the hightest in 2015_, and the numbers of injured people as well as victims _kept going high until 2017_.
